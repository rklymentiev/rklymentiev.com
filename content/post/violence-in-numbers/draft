We also know that role in crimes might not be equal during the crime execution. Sometimes there is an instigator, or as we refer to them in criminology research, a recruiter, who

The findings align with insights from Stanley Milgram’s famous obedience experiments. In these studies, participants were instructed by an authority figure to administer what they believed were painful electric shocks to another person. Many complied, later justifying their actions by claiming they were "just following orders." The group setting and presence of authority reduced their sense of personal responsibility, making it easier to commit harmful acts.

She was assessing how social situations affect an individual’s sense of agency, the sense that an individual is the one responsible for her/his own actions. 

In the first experiment, The feedback-related negativity (FRN) is an ERP-component associated with monitoring the consequences of action (see San Martın, 2012 for a review). Importantly, this component is sensitive to the perceived controllability of action outcomes: when participants believe that an outcome is uncontrollable, the FRN to negative outcomes is greatly reduced (Yeung et al., 2005; Li et al., 2011). ERP results showed an effect of social context on the neural processing of action outcomes. In otherwise identical trials, FRN amplitude to outcomes of successful actions was reduced by the co-player’s presence.

Electrical stimulation of the anterior portion of precuneus can induce an out of body experience.
