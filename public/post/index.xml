      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seeking a criminal partner is not unlike searching for a dance partner on a Saturday night. Humans are inherently social creatures, driven by the innate need to connect with others. We interact with other people almost every day, forming a so-called &amp;ldquo;social network&amp;rdquo;. Think about your close friends and try to remember why you became friends with them in the first place. Was it because you already had friends in common? Did they attract you because they shared the same interests? Or did they simply appear to be in the right place and at the right time in your life? In reality, it could be a combination of everything. Interestingly, regardless of the end goal - whether it is dancing or robbery - the mechanisms underlying these social connections have remarkable similarities.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;criminals-and-criminal-networks&#34;&gt;Criminals and criminal networks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we use the term “criminal” or “offender” we refer to a person who breaks the laws and rules of a given country. Some crimes can be performed by one person, such as tax fraud. However, some criminal acts can require collaboration between several people. For example, criminal literature indicates that burglary has the highest prevalence of co-offending. In working together, it is believed that criminals may form social networks, which we call “criminal networks”. These networks can serve as a pool of potential partners and collaborations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:56%;position:relative;&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://giphy.com/embed/3o6gbchrcNIt4Ma8Tu&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; style=&#34;position:absolute&#34; frameBorder=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;giphy-embed&#34; allowFullScreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose someone is seeking a partner to rob a house. What qualities would be the most important in a potential partner in crime? Let&amp;rsquo;s look at business partnerships as an example to answer this question. Production companies often require external help to develop new solutions and products. When seeking help, they look for companies that are trustworthy, competitive, and willing to collaborate. Similarly, when it comes to robbery, criminals are more likely to team up with someone who has relevant experience, can be trusted not to betray them, and is currently available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;its-not-what-you-know-but-who-you-know&#34;&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not what you know but who you know&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our social networks can consist of many individuals, but we can&amp;rsquo;t afford equal time and attention to all of them. We tend to interact more frequently with a select few, termed &amp;ldquo;strong ties,&amp;rdquo; representing our close friendships. Simultaneously, we maintain &amp;ldquo;weak ties&amp;rdquo;, representing acquaintances and people we see less often. 
 that weak ties play a valuable role in our networks. The importance of weak ties might feel counterintuitive, but there is a rationale behind it. If you have a small but very connected group of people you interact with daily, you are likely exposed to the same information and opportunities and there is no room for exploring new things. And if you are looking for a new job, all your close professional contacts are more likely to have the same options in mind as you have already tried. However, a random post with a vacancy ad on LinkedIn from a person you barely know might open a door for new opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is believed that criminals might experience the same when it comes to a criminal partner selection. 
 that offenders might use both types of ties, strong and weak. Using this approach criminals interact with strong ties that are defined by the high level of trust to commit crimes together, but at the same time, they also rely on weak ties for accessing new skills and information. However, some criminals might prefer only strong ties, as these collaborations may have a higher chance of success and fewer chances of betrayal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;people-like-people-like-them&#34;&gt;People like people like them&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there should be something that attracts us to individuals to create any type of connection. Consider your friends and the common interests and opinions you share. Chances are, you are probably very similar to your friends in some areas, such as music taste, religious beliefs, or shared sports activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her 
, Gwendolyn Seidman discusses why we might tend to like people who have or are perceived to have similar interests as us. There are several possible explanations for this phenomenon. For instance, when we see someone who has similar attitudes toward the world, we become more confident that our own attitudes are appreciated and correct. Another possible explanation is that we believe that people who have a lot in common with us are more likely to like us in return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In criminal partners, it is not always straightforward to assess how similar or dissimilar they are in terms of interests, political views, or religion. What we do know, however, is that criminals would rather co-offend with someone who is the same sex and around the same age as them. After analyzing survey data from US schools, 
 that adolescents who participate in delinquent activities have an even stronger preference for similar friends, compared to nondelinquent  adolescents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, 
 a theory of triadic closure. In simple terms, this theory suggests that if you have two friends who are similar to you, but they don’t know each other yet, they are more likely to be similar as well and become friends as well. This social phenomenon has been replicated in studies of co-offending groups, showing that criminals are more likely to co-offend with the partner of their previous partners. 
 that it is even more likely to collaborate with the partner of your previous partner than to choose a &amp;ldquo;popular&amp;rdquo; criminal or collaborate with the same person as before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;right-place-right-time&#34;&gt;Right place, right time?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important question is whether humans are always guided by rational calculations when forming new connections. Do we consider all the pros and cons of a person we want to go dancing with or perform a thorough risk-benefit analysis? Often the individuals we share experiences with enter our lives spontaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, in her work, 
, Ann Teresa Cordilia has shown that some criminal events happen on the spur of the moment. She discussed how group drinking situations might give rise to casual robbery. Here is a quote from one of the interviews:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;G. L. and R. were drinking and were “half crocked”. S. said he knew about a car [which they could steal] which somebody wanted so they could get rid of it. G. had doubts because he didn’t want to violate his parole. But he went along anyway and that’s how he ended up [in prison].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:56%;position:relative;&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://giphy.com/embed/fjxbfQKLcKzAJIqSuD&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; style=&#34;position:absolute&#34; frameBorder=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;giphy-embed&#34; allowFullScreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 that need to be met for a co-offense to occur. Firstly, the co-offenders must gather physically at the same place and time. Secondly, they should be able to communicate with each other without any interference from outside. Lastly, they must have enough time to socialize before committing the offense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;closing-remarks&#34;&gt;Closing remarks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studying social behavior among criminals is a crucial yet challenging task. Understanding how offenders find partners can assist law enforcement in preventing future collaborations and ensuring a safer society. One thing we can say for certain is that it is far wiser to enjoy the company of friends in a bar than to end up behind bars.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How Do Criminals Make Decisions?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/post/how-do-criminals-make-decisions/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:4321/post/how-do-criminals-make-decisions/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to read the mind of criminals for sure sounds exciting. On the one hand, it can help with the understanding of the nature of human violence. On the other hand, it can help prevent future crimes. TV shows like Profiler, Criminal Minds, and Mindhunter have tried to depict what it is like to get into the mind of offenders. In such shows, a group of special agents usually investigates the crime scenes, talks to the witnesses and relatives of the victim, and then tries to build up a profile of the offender using the combination of the obtained information and the relevant historical crime data. Such analysis helps them understand the offenders’ motives and predict their future actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;criminal_minds.png&#34; width=&#34;600&#34; alt=&#34;Figure 1&#34;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 1&lt;/b&gt;. Photo from the “Broken Wing” episode of Criminal Minds. Source: IMDb.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I will give an overview of how such fields as economics, psychology, and criminology have combined in real life to investigate criminal behavior. I will briefly introduce the economic models of human decision-making and how they have been tested in criminal research. Additionally, I will introduce other factors that may influence offenders’ decision-making, such as emotions, mental health impairments, and social interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;decision-making-assessment&#34;&gt;Decision-Making Assessment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As exciting as it may sound, assessing anyone’s decision-making processes is not the most straightforward task. However, there is still something we can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine you want to know whether you have abnormal blood sugar levels. If you went to a doctor, they could take a blood sample to check your glucose level. Then the doctor would compare your results with the “normal” values and speculate how substantial the deviation is. In this case, these normal values would be the conventional ones. Say, on average for healthy people of your gender, age, and dietary preferences, the glucose level is in a $[a, b]$ range. Comparing your results to these values could tell whether your blood sugar level is low, normal, or high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s apply the same idea to decision-making measures. Even though it may sound more abstract, over the last decade, scholars have developed several tests and games that could help understand patterns and approaches people make when facing particular dilemmas. The same as for the blood sugar values, outcomes of such tests alone may not be very informative as when compared between different groups. For example, if we wanted to know whether burglars show, on average, a risky behavior, the good approach would be asking “Riskier than who?”. And then compare the test results between burglars and the control non-burglary group, which ideally would perfectly match by relevant parameters, such as gender, social-economic status, demographic, etc. Table 1 gives an overview of several such games that will also be mentioned later in this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;background-color:#f2f2f2;color:black;border:1px&#34;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ultimatum Game (UG)&lt;/strong&gt;: This is a two-player game with one person being a Proposer and the other being a Responder. At the beginning of the game, the Proposer is given money, which they have to split between themselves and the Responder. The Responder can either accept the offer or decline. If the Responder accepts the offer, both players receive the money as proposed by the Proposer, whereas rejected offer results in both players receiving nothing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cambridge Gambling Task (CGT)&lt;/strong&gt;: Individuals bet on the occurrence of either of two mutually exclusive events (whether a token is hidden inside either a red or blue box) differing in their probability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iowa Gambling Task (IGT)&lt;/strong&gt;: Individuals choose from four decks of cards, which differ in their reward-punishment profiles. Two decks are advantageous and result in an overall high reward. Two other decks are disadvantageous and result in more significant losses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Affective Decision-Making-Task (ADMT)&lt;/strong&gt;: Participants are learning to approach or avoid different stimuli that have different probabilistic reinforcement profiles. At the start of each trial, the task-irrelevant angry or happy face is presented. This introduces the emotional biasing of instrumental action, whereby angry faces provoke instrumental avoidance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;b&gt;Table 1&lt;/b&gt;. Example of decision-making tasks used in decision-making research. Adapted from Jones et al. (2019)[^3]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another more theoretical approach is comparing the offenders’ behavior to the behavior from so-called &lt;strong&gt;normative models&lt;/strong&gt;. Normative models provide a standard for defining the type of thinking that is optimal for achieving one’s goals. Whereas &lt;strong&gt;descriptive models&lt;/strong&gt;, on the other hand, refer to theories of how people typically think and make decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;playing-games-with-offenders&#34;&gt;Playing Games with Offenders&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2019 Jones and colleagues performed a review and meta-analysis of experiments on the offenders’ decision-making (Jones et al., 2019&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;). Even though the individual studies showed that offenders with mental disorders make poorer decisions compared to controls, the meta-analysis didn’t reveal statistical significance in their performance (IGT was chosen as a primary means of comparison). Let’s take a look at some individual studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a study by Radke et al. (2013)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, social decision-making was compared between three groups of subjects, male offenders with and without psychopathy and healthy controls, using the UG. Results showed that offenders without psychopathic traits showed deficits in social decision-making, while offenders with psychopathy behaved similarly to healthy controls, showing the same rejection rates for the proposals. On the other hand, results from Koenigs et al. (2010)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; revealed no difference in the acceptance rate between secondary psychopaths and non-psychopaths. Still, they found a lower acceptance of unfair offers for primary psychopaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nishinaka et al. (2016)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; looked at the decision-making of Japanese forensic psychiatric patients using IGT. Forensic patients exhibited poorer performance than the control group since they were less likely to avoid making risky selections during the task, suggesting that they may fail to learn from emotional feedback. Authors conclude that forensic patients with psychiatric disorders exhibit a wide range of neuropsychological impairments, suggesting that these impairments may increase the risk of violent behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In line with these results, Kirkpatrick and colleagues also showed that offenders with mental health impairment show risky behavior (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;). They compared offenders with histories of serious violent or sexual offences and a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder (BPD) with controls (please refer to the original publication for the description of the task). Offenders with BPD engaged in more risky options than controls, exhibiting deficits in processing information about the potential loss when the probability of gains was high. Authors argued that a diagnosis of BPD and a history of serious offences result in problems integrating different reinforcement signals when choosing between risky actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DeBrito et al. (2013)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; examined executive functioning in violent offenders with antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) and psychopathy, violent offenders with ASPD without psychopathy, and non-offenders using CGT. Results showed that both groups of offenders made poorer decisions. The decision time was increasing as the box ratio became less favorable, which suggests that offender groups were aware of the changing probabilities and increased risk of losing points but did not adjust their behavior. Authors related this to real-life decision-making, when antisocial behavior is continued, despite an awareness of the negative consequences. There were no between-group differences for offender groups, suggesting similar decision-making patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the ADMT, Ly et al. (2016)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; examined affective decision-making in violent offenders with a history of psychiatric disorders and controls with no criminal record or history of mental illness. Results showed that control participants avoided angry faces, but violent offenders did not. Results suggest disordered affective processing in violent offender groups. This may explain to some extent why people with a history of violent offending may not be affected by social-emotional cues (e.g., screaming or crying) that would interfere with their decision to commit the act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examining the relationship between offending behavior and mental health is particularly interesting since evidence exists for higher rates of mental disorders among prisoners than in the general population (such as psychosis, substance use disorders, or depression). Moreover, mental illnesses increase re-offending risk (Jones et al., 2019&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref1:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;behavioral-economics-models&#34;&gt;Behavioral Economics Models&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We don’t have to stop inventing abstract models that describe the behavior of imaginary Econs. We do, however, have to stop assuming that those models are accurate descriptions of behavior, and stop basing policy decisions on such flawed analysis.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;― Richard H. Thaler, Misbehaving: The Making of Behavioural Economics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behavioral economics has been particularly useful in modeling human decision-making, and later these models have been applied in criminology. However, for most theories and models, there is always controversy and inconsistency, especially when we think about complex human nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rational-choice-and-expected-utility-theory&#34;&gt;Rational Choice and Expected Utility Theory&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rational choice theory prescribes that individuals perform a cost-benefit analysis to make rational choices and achieve outcomes that fit their needs and desires. Consider an ultimatum game with you being a Responder. The Proposer has been given 100 dollars and proposed you take $x$ of it (while they end up with $(100-x)$). Would you accept the offer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Option 1: accept the offer.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Benefits&lt;/em&gt;: $x$ dollars.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Costs&lt;/em&gt;: 0.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Option 2: reject the offer.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Benefits&lt;/em&gt;: 0.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Costs&lt;/em&gt;: 0.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being entirely rational, you would choose option one since the benefits outweigh the costs regardless of how much the Proposer would offer. Or in other words, you would rather end up with any amount of money than nothing. However, as one could imagine, human decision-making has much more to unpack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, economic theory introduces the term &lt;strong&gt;utility function&lt;/strong&gt; $U = f(X)$ that, technically speaking, reflects the total satisfaction/benefit an actor gets from the consumption of the commodities. For instance, an incremental dollar bill given to a billionaire has less utility than an incremental dollar bill given to someone with nothing. In the simple case, the utility function could be linear $U(X) = X$ (Figure 2), where utility is the same as the absolute wealth obtained from the goods. More commonly proposed function is however $U(X) = \sqrt{X}$, which includes the &lt;em&gt;risk aversion&lt;/em&gt;. Risk aversion property will be discussed later in the post. The main point of the utility function is that not all risks, costs, and benefits carry equal weight in the decision-making process for different individuals or for the same individual over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;utility_function.png&#34; width=&#34;600&#34; alt=&#34;Figure 2&#34;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 2. Utility as a function of absolute wealth.&lt;/b&gt; For the risk-neutral condition (black line), utility is the same as wealth. For the risk aversive condition (red line), the shape of the utility function is concave, and the marginal increase of the high wealth values adds just a little to the utility (an increase from 0 to 50 dollars perceives better than an increase from 1500 to 1550 dollars). For the risk-seeking condition (green line), the shape of the utility function is convex, and the marginal increase of the high wealth values adds a lot to the utility (an increase from 1500 to 1550 dollars perceives better than an increase from 0 to 50 dollars).&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, think about two scenarios. In the first one, the Proposer suggests a 50-50 split, and 95-5 (where the Proposer takes the bigger half) in the second one. Would your decision of acceptance be the same? Various experiments have shown that people are more likely to accept the offer in the first case but reject the offer in the second case. Moreover, Schweitzer and Gibson (2008)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; found that when people think they are mistreated, they become angry at the person responsible for it and feel justified in taking revenge. As discussed before, in both scenarios, a Responder initially starts with 0 and ends with a value greater than 0. So in terms of maximizing self-interest, both actions are considered optional. However, the problem is that humans are often not rational. We can feel unfairness or jealousy when given just 5 dollars out of 100, so we may reject the offer to “punish” the Proposer in return. This is the flaw of rational choice theory. It doesn’t account for emotions, cultural nuance, or unconscious behavior and instead shows how decisions &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, it is worth mentioning that actors often face uncertainty around events and actions in real life. Imagine somewhat different rules of a game. Now the Proposer flips a coin. If it comes up Heads, they split the money with $x$ for you and $(100-x)$ for them, and if it comes up Tails, they take all the money. You can again either agree to flip the coin or reject it, and everyone ends with nothing. This is where the term &lt;strong&gt;expected utility&lt;/strong&gt; $\mathbb{E} \big[ U(X) \big]$ comes into play, which can be thought of as a sum of utility values weighted by their probabilities. Assuming $U(X) = X$ utility function we have the following options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Option 1: accept the game offer.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Benefits&lt;/em&gt;: $x$ dollars with the probability of 0.5.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Costs&lt;/em&gt;: 0 dollars with the probability of 0.5.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Expected utility&lt;/em&gt;: $\mathbb{E} \big[ U(X_1) \big] = 0.5 \cdot x + 0.5 \cdot 0 = \frac{x}{2}$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Option 2: reject the game offer.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Benefits&lt;/em&gt;: N/A.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Costs&lt;/em&gt;: 0 with the probability of 1 (certainly don’t lose anything).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Expected utility&lt;/em&gt;: $\mathbb{E} \big[ U(X_2) \big] = 1 \cdot 0 = 0$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case $\mathbb{E} \big[ U(X_1) \big] &gt; \mathbb{E} \big[ U(X_2) \big]$, so the rational actor would still choose to play regardless of the proposed amount in the case of Heads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus probabilities of benefits and risks (which could be either known or perceived) affect the decision-making. For example, in a series of experiments, Casey and Scholz (1991)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; found that ambiguity around detection risk reduced college students’ willingness to commit tax noncompliance when detection risk was low but had the opposite effect when detection risk was high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, apart from uncertainty, humans face other factors like imperfect information or time constraints that limit their rationality. When you want to buy the best sauce for pasta, you will not consider different sauces in every grocery store in your city. In the same way, when a burglar wants to rob a house, they probably will not explore &lt;em&gt;each&lt;/em&gt; house in the neighborhood to find the target that fulfills all criteria. This reflects so-called &lt;em&gt;bounded rationality&lt;/em&gt;, which suggests that humans make suboptimal decisions that are good enough for the current state of the environment, purposes, etc. Bounded decision-making has been shown in the review of sexual crimes by Pedneault et al. (2017)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. They have shown that often the decisions were sub-optimal and were concerned for immediate positive and negative outcomes but discounted delayed consequences. For example, the selected crime location could be accessed by a third party, preventing the crime. These results also suggest that sexual offenders engage in myopic decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, humans often make “intuitive” decisions using so-called cognitive heuristics (shortcuts), which may lead to systematic biases. Such heuristics save effort but can reduce the accuracy. For example, for residential burglars, environmental cues (the lighting, conspicuousness of the target, etc.) constitute rules of thumb for intuitive cost-benefit perceptions. Pogarsky and Piquero (2003)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; have shown that offenders with a short criminal history tended to reduce their perceived arrest risk after experiencing punishment, which reflects the gambler’s fallacy. The &lt;strong&gt;gambler’s fallacy&lt;/strong&gt; is the incorrect belief that if a particular event occurs more frequently than normal during the past, it is less likely to happen in the future (or vice versa) when it has otherwise been established that the probability of such events does not depend on what has happened in the past. So it may look like such offenders are using the philosophy “If I was caught once, it’s doubtful that I will be caught again”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;prospect-theory&#34;&gt;Prospect Theory&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prospect theory&lt;/strong&gt; describes how humans &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; make decisions without rationality assumption. It prescribes that individuals make decisions based on expectations of loss or gain from their relative position (sometimes called the reference point). An essential element of prospect theory is that individuals are particularly averse to losing what they already have and less concerned about gaining. Given a choice of equal probability, individuals would choose to preserve their existing wealth rather than risk the chance to increase wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;prospective_value.png&#34; width=&#34;600&#34; alt=&#34;Figure 3&#34;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 3. Prospective value.&lt;/b&gt; The perceived value function has a concave shape for the Gains domain and a convex shape for the Losses domain. Gains and Losses of the same magnitude (for example, 50) are perceived differently.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider a classical &lt;strong&gt;Asian disease paradox&lt;/strong&gt;. Imagine that the US is preparing for an unusual Asian disease outbreak, which is expected to kill 600 people. Two alternative programs to combat the disease have been proposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem 1&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Program A: 200 people will be saved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Program B:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1/3 probability that 600 people will be saved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2/3 probability that no people will be saved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which of the two programs would you prefer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem 2&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Program A: 400 people will die.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Program B:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1/3 probability that nobody will die.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2/3 probability that 600 people will die.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, which of the two programs would you prefer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you paid close attention to the numbers and expected outcome, you could notice that programs use the same logic in both problems but are described differently. However, Tversky and Kahneman have shown that people are more likely to select program A in the first problem and program B in the second one (Tversky &amp;amp; Kahneman, 1981&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;). The main idea here is that humans have different preferences depending on their perceptions. An emphasis on gains evokes risk-averse behavior, whereas a focus on losses evokes risk-seeking behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hyperbolic shape of preferences for gains and losses can also be observed for delayed outcomes. Loughran and colleagues collected data from university undergraduate students who responded to a hypothetical scenario involving drunk driving (Loughran et al., 2012&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;). Participants had to indicate the estimated probability that they would drink and drive under the conditions described in the scenario. Scenarios involved several time points, starting from “tonight” up to “10 years from now”. They found that participants put more weight on close-in-time outcomes than the same outcomes in some observable future, whereas this was more pronounced for gains than losses. For example, when the benefit of drinking and driving was delayed by one week, the self-reported intention to drink and drive increased by nearly 10%. However, when the gain was postponed by one month, intentions to drink and drive increased by only 4%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whichard and Felson (2016)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; have related loss aversion property to the crimes that a priori have a low probability of success. For example, a target of a verbal attack which is facing the options to retaliate and possibly get physical injuries or to walk away and lose face, could go with the first option if they perceive losing face as a more significant loss. Another example would be the increased likelihood of homicide. Offenders are likely to anticipate a specific loss if they know that the victim or other witnesses can identify them. When offenders believe that allowing a witness to survive will lead to incarceration, homicide is more likely. The risk of severe punishment increases, but they take the risk to avoid a sure loss. The perception of inevitable loss is also expected to lead to lethal intent when people conflict with an armed or otherwise dangerous adversary. They are likely to take significant risks when
it is “kill or be killed” and may engage in preemptive strikes when they anticipate an attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, the decision to resist the arrest may also seem irrational due to the estimated low chances of success. However, once the suspect perceives that they will be arrested, this realization can shift the offender’s reference point such that the impending arrest is a loss, thereby triggering the type of risk-seeking behavior that resisting arrest entails. However, as the authors pointed out, the decision to perform “senseless” or irrational choices can be influenced not only by the desire to avoid a sure loss but also by intoxication, mental impairments (as discussed in the 
 section), or intelligence lack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, a large body of literature suggests that individuals are more likely to make risky decisions when they are emotionally aroused. An example of such findings is work from Ariely and Lowenstein (2006)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Recruited male undergraduate students were asked to evaluate the attractiveness of different sexual activities under the effect of high arousal achieved by masturbation. Results revealed that participants in the aroused group were more willing to engage in “date-rape” like behaviors and risky sexual practices than the control group. For example, they got significantly higher answer scoring for the questions like “Would you keep trying to have sex after your date says ‘no’?” or “Would you slip a woman a drug to increase the chance that she would have sex with you?” and lower scoring for the questions like “Would you always use a condom if you didn’t know the sexual history of a new sexual partner?”. Although it is important to note that the authors didn’t observe actual behavior, the questionnaire responses, so the results show what subjects &lt;em&gt;think they would do&lt;/em&gt; in situations like these rather than &lt;em&gt;what they did&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, the decision to offend may be produced in a reinforcement way. If individuals experience that acts of crime do not result in legal punishment or feelings of shame or guilt, they may, over time, internalize the idea that such acts are acceptable or justifiable, thus, adjusting their perceptions about risks and costs. If the consequences of the action were overall positive, individuals would change their perceptions of rewards accordingly and would be more likely to engage in similar acts in the future. Vice versa, when individuals feel that an experience does not meet their expectations about the potential “thrill” or increased social status, they may internalize this and readjust their perceptions of benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;social-influence&#34;&gt;Social Influence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of how strongly we believe that we don’t rely on the opinion or validation of others, we are still social creatures. Here I will provide several notes on the social influence on offender decision-making based on the comprehensive review by Hoeben and Thomas (2019)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:16&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. As discussed in the 
 part, most of the time, we don’t have enough information about all the possible outcomes of all possible actions. But even if an individual has never experienced the crime they are about to commit, observation of others may shape their own perceived costs and benefits. For example, observing peers getting away with a crime may decrease an individual’s risk of being caught, and vice versa, when individuals observe that their peers are caught and punished, it may increase their perceived sanction risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, as highlighted by Hoeben and Thomas, the influence of peers can be &lt;em&gt;passive&lt;/em&gt; (without direct interaction) and &lt;em&gt;active&lt;/em&gt; (with direct interaction). For the passive peer influence authors highlight five important points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social validation can play an important role without being directly involved in crime decision-making. According to Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs theory, humans have the need for affection, intimacy, and acceptance. When these needs are not met, they can experience feelings of inferiority and weakness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Presence of peers may increase the weight attributed to social costs and rewards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Presence of peers may reduce the perceived risk of detection. For example, McGloin and Thomas (2016)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:17&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:17&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; showed that as the size of the co-offending group increased, the anticipation of sanction risk and several informal social costs associated with engaging in the act decreased.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Presence of others may reduce the feeling of responsibility, shame, or guilt. Acting in a social group may induce a psychological sense of unity, like fans feeling the one with the tribunes while shouting their favorite team slogan during the football game. During this state, individuals may feel more unidentifiable and unaccountable. For example, studies have shown that the presence of peers lowers one’s expectations about the risks associated with crime and makes individuals more tolerant of such risks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Individuals may have stronger feelings (both anticipated or experienced) of excitement or thrill when in the presence of peers as compared with when being alone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of active influence, peers can “fill the gaps” in the missing information of the decision-making process of an individual and therefore influence the anticipated risks and benefits (e.g., “It will be a thrill” or “Relax, my friend John has done that and it went good”). This can be done in the form of a discussion of the potential crime but also in the form of the instigation. Co-offending can also reduce the time needed for a crime or make the crime execution easier. But at the same time, it may increase the risks since of the possibility of betrayal, the problem with incompetency group members, or unfair profit shares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarize, it was a brief overview of research literature that assesses offenders’ decision-making. Even though criminals can be thought of as impulsive and reckless, the literature suggests they can be rational (even in a bounded way) and perform a cost-benefit analysis. Some external or internal factors however may affect the rational action selection, such as intoxication, mental health history, or the influence of peers. Note that none of those mentioned above papers leads to the causal relationship. For example, it is not clear what happened first, whether acts of crime are a result of individuals’ risky behavior or whether the history of offending has changed individuals’ risk perception.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post aims to give a brief review of psychopathy as a neuropsychiatric disorder. It starts with a discussion of features that define the psychopath. Then it takes a closer look at some of the traits, such as empathy, to show the general beliefs and controversy across the studies with the provided overview of the dysfunctions in the brain and impairments that stem from them. Lastly, the post includes an overview of research on “successful” and “unsuccessful” psychopaths and assesses the literature-based opinion on whether psychopathy can be treated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for mental health research in general, results can often be controversial. Therefore, even if I did not mention the study that failed to reproduce the same results or found the opposite results, it does not mean that such studies do not exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And no, this post is not about Vladimir Putin, although there is a reason to believe that he might have some psychopathic features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;basic-traits-of-psychopathy&#34;&gt;Basic Traits of Psychopathy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wanted charming, aggressive, carefree people who are impulsively irresponsible but are good at handling people and at looking after number one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a snippet of an advertisement in a Boston newspaper aimed to recruit participants with psychopathy for a study conducted by Cathy Widom in the seventies (Widom, 1977&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;). This short sentence gives a perfect overview of the complex disorder. A typical representative would normally have high irresponsibility and impulsivity rates, grandiose sense of self-worth, show an anti-social behavior, but at the same time could be extremely charming. The combination of these traits can make one relatively dangerous for society and consequently psychopathy is often associated with violent behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as one could guess, &lt;em&gt;typical&lt;/em&gt; does not mean &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt;, that is why we cannot imply that all psychopaths have the same set of traits and psychopathy does not necessarily make one an offender. Originally research on psychopathy was biased toward convicted subjects, but over the last decades have been shifted to investigating the psychopathy in the general population. Indeed, many individuals with psychopathy are not violent, as the media could portray them, but rather organized and foresighted. Some of them can be highly successful in their professional careers and can be found in all areas of life (e.g., business, banking, law).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this date, the etiology of psychopathy is not well established (Perez, 2012&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;), however, several neural correlates and impairments can be distinguished, which will be reviewed later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;assessment&#34;&gt;Assessment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harpur et al. (1989)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; have suggested a two-factor model of psychopathy, which divides it into primary, or Factor 1, and secondary, or Factor 2. Factor 1 covers interpersonal and affective traits, such as callousness and grandiosity. Whereas Factor 2 comprises impulsive and anti-social behavior. Primary psychopathy can be also named &amp;ldquo;successful&amp;rdquo; psychopathy, since it can be beneficial for achieving life-goals and increasing power in society. In fact, the estimated prevalence of psychopathy in the business world is 3-4% compared to 0.6-1% in the general population (Babiak &amp;amp; Hare, 2006&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;). On the other hand, secondary psychopathy is the one that is more likely to lead to criminal behavior (Skeem et al., 2011&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R) is a commonly used measure of psychopathy (Hare, 2003&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;), which consists of four facets. These facets can be further summarized by two higher-order factors. The PCL-R involves a relatively time-consuming (around 2 hours) semi-structured interview and file review that is used by the interviewer to rate the presence of 20 characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;background-color:#f2f2f2;color:black;padding:10px;border:1px&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Factor 1&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facet 1 (Interpersonal)&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Glibness/superficial harm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grandiose sense of self-worth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pathological lying&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conning/manipulative&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facet 2 (Affective)&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of remorse of guilt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shallow affect&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Callousness/Lack of empathy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Failure to accept responsibility for own actions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Factor 2&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facet 3 (Lifestyle)&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Need for stimulation/proneness to boredom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Impulsivity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Irresponsibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of realistic, long-term goals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facet 4 (Antisocial)&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Early behavioral problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poor behavioral controls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jouvenile delinquency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revocation of conditional release&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Criminal versatility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Items that did not saturate any factor:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Promiscuous sexual behavior&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many short-term marital relationships&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;b&gt;Table 1&lt;/b&gt;. Elements of the PCL-R (Hare, 2003)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research has shown that Factor 2 traits of psychopathy are associated with environmental factors (e.g., childhood trauma). There is also a positive correlation with depression, substance abuse symptoms, and anxiety, whereas Factor 1 has little or no association with these factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;can-psychopaths-feel-empathy&#34;&gt;Can Psychopaths Feel Empathy?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though it is commonly believed that psychopaths do not have empathy (the ability &lt;em&gt;to understand&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;share&lt;/em&gt; the feelings of another), the results across studies are not homogeneous. Moreover, the term &amp;ldquo;empathy&amp;rdquo; is often used interchangeably with the terms &amp;ldquo;sympathy&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;compassion&amp;rdquo; (the ability &lt;em&gt;to be concerned&lt;/em&gt; about the well-being of another), while they may have slightly different meanings (van Dongen, 2020&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Review from Burghart and Mier (2022)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; showed rather low to moderate associations between different aspects and psychopathy, such as empathy (&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;=−0.31), empathic concern (&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;=−0.29), alexithymia (&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;= 0.21), and personal distress (&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;=−0.14). The results also varied by psychopathy factors, and some were moderated by gender. For example, women are characterized by more emotional dysregulation than men (Kreis &amp;amp; Cooke, 2011&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results from van Dongen et al. (2018)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; showed that participants with higher &amp;ldquo;meanness&amp;rdquo; scores showed empathy for the perpetrator, but not the victim, while passively watching the pictures of aggressive (physical, sexual, or verbal) and neutral situations between two individuals. Also, meanness was positively correlated with subjective ratings of aggressive pictures, indicating that such situations were rather &amp;ldquo;enjoyable&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Positive association with alexithymia can be of particular interest since it suggests that subjects with psychopathy struggle to identify and describe emotions experienced by themselves. The study by Garofalo and colleagues showed that emotion dysregulation plays a role in explaining the connection between psychopathy and aggression (Garofalo et al., 2020&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;). Additionally, Shane and Groat (2018)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; have shown that subjects with psychopathy can increase or decrease their emotional response if they are asked to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar results have been achieved by Meffert et al. (2013)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. 20 male subjects with psychopathy have watched videos of hand interactions, with 4 conditions depicted, love (hands caressing), pain (one hand hitting the other), social exclusion (one hand pushing away the other friendly hand), and neutral (approaching hand touching the other and getting a non-emotional response) videos. Results showed reduced activation of brain areas involved in empathy compared to controls. However, similarly to Shane &amp;amp; Groat (2018)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref1:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, reduction became less prominent when subjects were instructed to emphasize the person in the video. These findings suggest that psychopaths &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; empathize with people around, but the corresponding neural system is &amp;ldquo;switched off&amp;rdquo; by default. This finding can also be implemented for violence prevention and treatment in the population by means &amp;ldquo;teaching&amp;rdquo; individuals with psychopathy to empathize other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;brain-malfunctions&#34;&gt;Brain Malfunctions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies suggest that subjects with psychopathy have impairments in several brain regions compared to healthy controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Birbaumer et al. (2005)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; study showed reduced amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) activation during the aversive differential conditioning experiment (Figure 1). OFC has been associated with the anticipation of punishment and reward and the ability to adapt learning in a volatile environment. The interaction of the amygdala and OFC seems to be crucial for encoding expected outcomes during learning. Subjects were presented with a set of 4 male neutral faces, which were used as conditional stimulus (CS). Painful pressure was used as an unconditional stimulus (US). Healthy controls showed sustained activation of the left amygdala throughout the acquisition phase, whereas the psychopaths displayed only right amygdala activation. Additionally, psychopaths showed reduced OFC activation, especially in the second half of the acquisition phase when the learned association needs to be translated into behavioral responses. Authors suggest that the psychopaths acquired some knowledge about the association between the CS and US but never processed the emotional significance of the association. However, intact the cognitive stimulus processing was intact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-love-with-fear&#34;&gt;In Love with Fear?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since amygdala is a key player in fear/risk processing, such impairments can explain a lack of fear in the psychopathic population to some extent. One of the earliest studies by Hare (1965)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; showed that psychopathic traits were related to lower and delayed arousal when anticipating an electric shock. Similarly, Blair et al. (2004)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:16&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; study showed that subjects with psychopathy performed worse at passive avoidance learning task (learning the association between numbers and point rewards, which could be positive or negative). Furthermore, their performance was not modulated by the level of punishment, compared to the control group. This could explain the good performance on tasks involving rewards only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kiehl et al. (2001)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:17&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:17&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; study compared three groups of subjects, criminal psychopaths, criminal non-psychopaths, and noncriminal controls, during the affective memory task. Subjects were asked to remember and later recognize a list of 12 words presented on a screen. The list of words included &amp;ldquo;negative&amp;rdquo; words (such as &amp;ldquo;hate&amp;rdquo;) and &amp;ldquo;neutral&amp;rdquo; words (such as &amp;ldquo;chair&amp;rdquo;). Results revealed that criminal psychopaths showed less affect-related activity, compared to the neutral baseline, than did criminal non-psychopaths and noncriminal controls in the rostral and caudal anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate, left inferior frontal gyrus, right amygdala, and ventral striatum. Importantly, there were no group differences in the above regions for processing neutral stimuli compared to the resting condition. These data suggest that the observed abnormalities in these regions for criminal psychopaths are limited to anomalies in processing affective stimuli and are not due to difficulties in processing neutral stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychopathy is also associated with a lower startle response (Oskarsson et al., 2021&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:18&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:18&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;). Strikingly, in Levenston et al. (2000)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:19&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:19&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; study the startle response became the same for pleasant (erotic or thrilling images) and aversive (threat and victim scenes) stimuli over time. The subjective rating and heart rate deceleration for aversive images were also lower compared to the control group, which could be seen as subjects from the psychopathy group showed &amp;ldquo;a pleasurable response to the distress of others&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the proposed Fear Enjoyment hypothesis (Hosker-Field et al., 2016&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:20&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:20&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) individuals high in psychopathic traits may experience positive affect in fear-inducing situations. They found that people with psychopathic traits, specifically Factor 1 traits, responded similarly to excitement and fear inducing videos (a skydiving clip was used as an excitement-inducing stimulus and a clip of a man being buried alive was from the movie &amp;ldquo;The Vanishing&amp;rdquo; was used as a fear-inducing stimulus). Finally, people with psychopathic traits were more likely to use positive descriptors when asked to explain what &amp;ldquo;fear&amp;rdquo; feels like and in their description of physiological experiences of fear. The Fear Enjoyment Hypothesis also overlaps with research that suggest that psychopathic traits are associated with the enjoyment of misfortune in others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;disturbances-in-decision-making&#34;&gt;Disturbances in Decision-Making&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Koenigs has reviewed the neuroimaging data and revealed two particular regions in PFC that show abnormal function, ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) (Koenigs, 2012&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:21&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:21&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;). It is believed that vmPFC is involved in many cognitive functions, such as risk and fear processing, decision-making, self-control, and morality, and ACC is associated with emotion regulation and social behavior. Psychopathy was associated with significant reductions in prefrontal gray matter in these two regions. Additionally, both psychopaths and patients with vmPFC lesions show reduced autonomic arousal to emotionally charged stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the earlier study, Koenigs used a group of prisoners (6 with primary psychopathy, 6 with secondary psychopathy, and 22 non-psychopaths) to play Ultimatum Game and Dictator Game. In the Ultimatum Game one player, the proposer, is endowed with a sum of money (Koenigs et al., 2010&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:22&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:22&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;). The proposer&amp;rsquo;s task is to split the money with another player, the responder. The responder may accept it or reject it. If the responder accepts, the money is split as it was proposed. If the responder rejects, both players receive nothing. Both players know in advance the consequences of the responder accepting or rejecting the offer. In the Dictator Game, there are again two players with an opportunity to split a sum of money. However, in this case, the responder has no choice but to accept whatever split the proposer offers. Results were compared with the performance of vmPFC lesion patients and data revealed that primary psychopaths and vmPFC lesion patients have somewhat similar economic decision-making performance. Both groups showed significantly reduced Ultimatum acceptance rates and significantly lower Dictator offers, whereas this was not the case for secondary psychopaths. These results also suggest that primary and secondary psychopaths may differ in their decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another comparison between subjects with psychopathy and subjects with lesions can be done with the help of Anderson et al. (1999)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:23&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:23&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; study. The authors looked at two subjects with early onset of frontal lobe damage due to the accident and tumor that happened in their early life (Figure 2). These subjects showed impairment of social and moral behavior, such as failure to comply with rules, confrontations with peers and adults, explosive outbursts of anger, and thievery. Additionally, during the Gambling Task, they failed to choose options with low immediate reward but positive long-term gains; rather, they persisted in choosing response options that provided high immediate reward but higher long-term loss. This is so-called myopic decision-making, which can be observed in subjects with psychopathy as well (Newman et al., 1992&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:24&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:24&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;anderson_et_al.png&#34; width=&#34;550&#34;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 2&lt;/b&gt;. 3-D reconstructed brain of patient 1 (subject A) and patient 2 (subject B). Adopted from Anderson et al. (1999)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another brain region that can be distinguished in subjects with psychopathy is the striatum, which is increased in volume compared to healthy controls (Glenn et al., 2010&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:25&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:25&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;; Choy et al., 2022&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:26&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:26&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;). Striatum plays a role in motor and action planning, decision-making, motivation, reinforcement, and reward perception. This structural difference may partially underlie the reward-seeking and decision-making deficits associated with psychopathy. It has been also shown that psychopathy is associated with great tendencies to make risky selections in the context of risky decision-making (Yao et al., 2019&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:27&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:27&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;27&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;need-for-control&#34;&gt;Need for Control&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The large body of literature shows the association between psychopathy and socially dominant behavior. A comprehensive review by Palmen et al. (2021)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:28&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:28&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;28&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; points out that social dominance is a characteristic of the primary psychopathy, particularly interpersonal and affective traits, which in turn leads to sociable behavior. Individuals with secondary psychopathy, on the other hand, may be more socially withdrawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study of Lobbestael et al. (2017)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:29&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:29&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;29&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 91 subjects underwent an identical interview with the subordinate or dominant interviewers. Dominant behavior towards the dominant interviewer has positively correlated with the high Factor 1 psychopathic traits. However, it was not the case for subjects with the high Factor 2 scores, who showed reduced defense distancing towards the interviewer (allowing the dominant interviewer to approach more closely).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the examining results of an online questionnaire (with 3531 participants) Glenn and colleagues (2017)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:30&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:30&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;30&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; found that subjects with psychopathy may even value power and control over people much more than financial success. Furthermore, financial success can be viewed only as a tool to achieve power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Son Hing et al. (2007)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:31&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:31&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;31&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; hypothesize that subjects with high social dominance rates have a greater chance to become leaders. Additionally, dominant behavior makes them look competent and proficient in their leadership, which is not necessarily the case. Using their charming and self-presentation skills they could easily create a perfect (but fake) image of a good leader and manipulate decision-makers into hiring them (Palmen et al., 2021&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref1:28&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:28&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;28&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;). In the earlier study, Palmen et al. (2019)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:32&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:32&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;32&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; proposed the model of the psychopathic leader (Figure 3). It suggests psychopathic individuals prefer leadership positions in order to fulfill the need for sensation seeking, gain financial success, and have control over other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 3&lt;/b&gt;. The model of the psychopathic leader. Adopted from Palmen et al. (2019).&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, while achievement of leadership positions is beneficial for the subject with psychopathy, it is not necessarily helpful for others and can harm organizations and employees. According to Palmen et al. (2021)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref2:28&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:28&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;28&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In several studies, psychopathic leaders were not only associated with their own negative job performance but their presence also had a negative impact on their employees. The studied employees were less committed to their organizations, exhibited lower work motivation, higher turn-over intentions, and higher job neglect. Furthermore, they felt dissatisfied with their supervisor and with their jobs and they experienced more frequent work-family related conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;psychopathy-and-crime&#34;&gt;Psychopathy and Crime&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we combine empathy, lack of fear, and dominant behavior in one individual, we have a perfect candidate for an offender. According to research, not all psychopaths are criminals, but those who are criminals are likely to be psychopaths. While the prevalence of psychopathy is around 1% in the general population, 20-30% of the prison population are found to have a psychopathic personality (Hare, 1999&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:33&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:33&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;33&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;). A review by Reidy et al. (2015)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:34&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:34&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;34&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; summarized that psychopaths commit some of the most severe acts of violence (which can result in greater injury and death) and at a higher rate compared to non-psychopathic offenders. Also, they have a higher chance to recidivate violently than non-psychopathic offenders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Porter et al. (2003)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:35&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:35&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;35&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; assessed 18 psychopathic and 20 non-psychopathic offenders and showed that the rate of sadistic behavior in homicides was 1.5 higher compared to non-psychopaths (82.4% compared to 52.6%). Additionally, they found that sadistic behavior was associated with Factor 1 traits and hypothesized that it could be a result of a lack of empathy combined with a thrill-seeking propensity. Similar results have been achieved by Holt et al. (1999)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:36&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:36&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;36&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, where psychopaths were found to be significantly more sadistic than non-psychopaths in a sample of 41 violent inmates at a maximum-security prison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been also shown that homicides by psychopathic offenders (mostly with Factor 1 traits) were mostly instrumental compared to the homicides by non-psychopathic offenders (Woodworth &amp;amp; Porter, 2002&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:37&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:37&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;37&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;). This means that their actions were planned, lacked emotions, and were motivated by external goals, rather than being impulsive. The authors bring an example of an inmate who carefully planned and murdered his wife because it allowed him to get financial gains from her insurance policy. Although, these results may not agree with the knowledge that psychopaths generally have high impulsivity rates (Hare, 1996&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:38&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:38&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;38&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;). Woodworth and Porter (2002)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref1:37&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:37&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;37&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; suggest the idea of &amp;ldquo;selective impulsivity&amp;rdquo;, meaning that psychopaths may plan their actions to perform the crime since the stakes are high. Although this also does not lay with the idea of myopic decision making (Newman et al., 1992&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref1:24&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:24&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reviewing the literature on &amp;ldquo;successful&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;unsuccessful&amp;rdquo; psychopaths, Gao et al. (2010)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:39&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:39&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;39&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; have suggested a model for these two aspects (Figure 4). While both groups have similar outcomes such as increased sensation-seeking (middle part), unsuccessful psychopathy seems to be more correlated with the impaired amygdala and OFC regions (top part), which may result in different manifestations (bottom part).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;can-psychopathy-be-cured&#34;&gt;Can Psychopathy be Cured?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given everything that has been said, one reasonable question to ask is &amp;ldquo;Can someone with psychopathy be treated?&amp;rdquo;. Unfortunately, research has not been very positive in this direction. While psychological interventions (e.g., cognitive behavior therapy, contingency management) are the most common choice of treatment, drug therapy has also been proposed (e.g., MDMA, oxytocin). But the initial problem with the treatment could be whether we even expect psychopaths to seek help. As one could imagine, psychopaths may perceive their traits as an advantage, rather than a disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An extensive review from Salekin et al. (2010)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:40&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:40&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;40&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; goes over reviews research on the psychopathy treatment with adults and youth. Authors indicate that researchers have contrasting opinions on the matter. While some suggest that treatment can potentially better the condition, others believe that it will have no effect or even worsen it. They also rose three problems that can appear during the treatment: (1) due to their cunning and manipulative nature, psychopaths may be simply &amp;ldquo;playing along&amp;rdquo; with the therapist; (2) even if they come to the treatment they are not particularly motivated to change; and (3) due to callousness psychopathic individuals cannot make strong attachments to others and thus are not able to do well in psychotherapy. Overall results suggest that treatment for adults shows low to moderate success, whereas treatment for youth is more promising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, some researchers have presumed that individuals with high levels of psychopathy maybe even untreatable (Harris and Rice, 2006&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:41&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:41&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;41&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary-and-conclusions&#34;&gt;Summary and Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With everything being said, we can summarize the main points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Psychopathy is a complex disorder with an unknown etiology and without well-established therapy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most commonly used model for psychopathy divides it into two factors, Factor 1 and Factor 2, which have different features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Psychopaths tend to achieve leadership positions (e.g., in business or politics) due to the need for control and social dominance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Individuals with psychopathy show impairments in several brain regions, including the amygdala, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not all psychopaths are criminals, but those who are criminals are likely to be psychopaths.&lt;/li&gt;
